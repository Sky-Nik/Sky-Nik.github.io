</h1>

<h3 class="mt-3">High School</h3>
<p>
    From 2009 to 2016 I studied at physics and mathematics lyceum in Kyiv.  I participated in a lot of different competitions, ranging from city geography olympiad and national chemistry olympiad to 2016 <a href="http://imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=26730">International Mathematical Olympiad</a> (IMO).  I won many different awards in many different sucjects, even though my main focus always remained on mathematics.

    You could have won gold at IMO if you studied more. <br>
    Nevertheless, I am still very proud of you.

<h3 class="mt-3">University</h3>
<p>
    After high school, I entered the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv.  This choice was motivated by my friends.  Our group consisted of two more IMO winners, a couple more national olympiad winners, and some more cool guys.  We went to one more olympiad all together, 2017 <a href="https://www.imc-math.org.uk/?year=2017&section=results&item=bysum">International Mathematical Olympiad for University Students</a>, where I won another silver medal.  After that, I got a little tired of participating in olympiads.
</p>

<h3 class="mt-3">Lecture Notes</h3>
<p>
    I do write a lot of lecture notes on my laptops.  Some of my major works can be found <a href="https://github.com/csc-knu">here</a>.  These include, but are not limited to <a href="https://csc-knu.github.io/sys-prog/lectures/tex/00+title.pdf">System Programming</a>, <a href="https://csc-knu.github.io/mph/lectures/">Mathematical Physics</a> in three chapters, <a href="https://csc-knu.github.io/de/lect/de-cover.pdf">Differential Equations</a>, <a href="https://csc-knu.github.io/numerical-analysis/lectures/">Numerical Analysis</a>, <a href="https://github.com/AndrewKhoma/data-analysis/blob/master/lec/data_analysis.pdf">Data Analysis</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Sky-Nik/control-theory/blob/master/ControlTheoryProblemsSolutions.pdf">Optimal Control Theory</a>.  More than a thousand pages overall, I guess.

<h3 class="mt-3">Freedom and Grades </h3>
<p>
    I always considered university as some sort of free environment, not visiting half of my lectures, and sometimes getting to know my instructor's name towards the end of the semester.  Nevertheless, I always did all the lab work and was getting good marks in the end.  Consequently, I finished with a GPA of 94.68/100, the best in my group by quite a margin.  I graduated with high honours in 2020, now a Bachelor of Sciences, majored in Applied Mathematics.

<h3 class="mt-3">The beginning</h3>
<p>
    In university I got interested in programming, especially in competitive.  It didn't come easy to me, as I failed to get <em>excellent</em> in my freshman pogramming course.  I eventually proceeded to get 100/100 in my next programming course, entered <a href="https://yandexdataschool.com/">Yandex School of Data Analysis</a> after my sophomore year.

<h3 class="mt-3">First Internship</h3>
<p>
    In July 2018 I started an internship at <a href="https://betterme.world/">BetterMe</a>, a fitness and health mobile application with millions of installations and subscriptions, where I worked as a backend engineer, analyst, and even a machine learning engineer in several advertisement-related tasks.

<h3 class="mt-3">Yandex School of Data Analysis</h3>
<p>
    In May 2019, after the internship, I came back to Yandex School of Data Analysis, completing various courses, ranging from programming languages and advanced mathematical courses to external memory algorithms and natural language processing.  I like this place, as it gathers many people with completely different backgrounds but with one goal of advanced education not available at most post-soviet and European universities.

<h3 class="mt-3">Competetive Programming</h3>
<p>
    After retiring from olympiad mathematics I wanted to keep my mind busy with some new challenges.  Programming problems turned out to be the perfect choice.  I join online contests quite often.  My favourite platforms and corresponding highest ratings are the following: <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/Skybytskyi.Nikita">CodeForces</a> (2138), <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/sky_nik">Codechef</a> (2174), <a href="hackerrank.com/nskybytskyi">HackerRank</a> (2185) and <a href="https://leetcode.com/nskybytskyi/">LeetCode</a> (2526).  Some of my contest codes can be found <a href="https://github.com/Sky-Nik/contest-cpp">here</a> (C++) and <a href="https://github.com/Sky-Nik/contest-python">here</a> (python).

    I like brain-teasing linguistic challenges.  In my school years I even took part in some competitions.  I guess I am still mentioned somewhere on a wonderful resource <a href="https://ling.org.ua/">Ling.org.ua</a> as a medalist of some competition.  Later on I even composed one problem.  You can check its statement in Ukrainian <a href="./assets/ling.pdf">here</a>.

<h3 class="mt-3">English</h3>
<p>
    I also like learning real languages.  However, my approach is rather intuitive and is not advised to use if you want to learn some language quickly.  I consider it more like a recreational activity in between working hours.  <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/learn">Duo</a> is quite fun if your schedule is not tight.  Otherwise, I suggest turning to some professional help, especially if you are preparing for some exam, like TOEFL or IELTS.

<h3 class="mt-3">Other</h3>
<p>
    I try to take a glimpse of many different languages.  In particular, I tried Spanish, French, Polish, and Czech.  Helps a lot to understand the general structures present in all languages.  Sometimes even helps to get a feeling of how native speakers think in their language.  I bet AIs from nearest future will tie linguistic background to some personality traits.

    I love running and cycling.  I took part in two Kyiv city half-marathons in the falls of 2018 and 2019, and plan to participate in more events in the future.  In the latter years cycling becomes an increasingly popular, fast, and most importantly safe way to move around Kyiv, despite the very slow official approvement of bike routes, and <a href="http://kievvlast.com.ua/news/klichko-zayavil-chto-v-kieve-obshhaya-dlina-velodorozhek-sostavlyaet-pochti-100-kilometrov?noredirect=true">hilarious length measurement manipulations</a>.
