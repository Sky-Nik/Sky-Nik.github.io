  It is a more detailed description of my education.  It includes coursework, grades, achievements, etc.

<h1 id="school">
  Physics and Mathematics Lyceum â„–208
</h1>

There is nothing special about it apart from its students earning 14 medals (5G, 7S, 2B) at the IMO over the past ten years (2010&ndash;2019).  Note that Ukraine had 11-years school education when I studied.  Therefore, Ukrainians are usually younger than other Europeans when participating in international olympiads.  For example, I graduated from school when I was 16.

<h3 id="school-gpa">
  GPA
</h3>

I can't remember the exact GPA, but I guess it was about 10.6/12 (in between A and A+) in my last year.  Some other years my GPA was as high as 11.5.  Such a drop is because I focused on preparing for IMO.    Anyway, I graduated with a gold medal (a.k.a. the High Honours).

<h3 id="school-coursework">
  Coursework

Coursework includes rather standard things: algebra, geometry, physics, chemistry, biology, geography, history, sports, some languages, some literature, even art and music classes once.

Speaking of achievements, I took part in far too many olympiads to remember all of them.  I guess I will only mention the city level and above:

- 2010 (5<sup>th</sup> grade):

    - third place at city math olympiad for 7<sup>th</sup> grade;

- 2011 (6<sup>th</sup> grade):

    - second place at city math olympiad for 7<sup>th</sup> grade;

    - second place at city math olympiad for 8<sup>th</sup> grade<a class="btn btn-link" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse-1" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse-1">&hellip;</a>

          Yeah, I wrote the olympiad for two different grades.  Such practice is somewhat unusual, but not prohibited.  In my case it was even strategically advantageous: to get into the selection round of Kyiv team for the national olympiad one had to get either first place in 7<sup>th</sup> grade or at least second place in 8<sup>th</sup> grade.  It turns out that the latter is sometimes easier.  By using this loophole in the regulations, I became one of something like five all-time youngest students who entered the selection round.

          This one was unexpected.  I thought I only got the knack for math, but it turned out that some preparation makes mathematicians extremely competitive in different subjects.

          Accidentally, I didn't make the Kyiv math team for the national olympiad.  That selection test was quite controversial, with many people believing that the head of the jury interpreted rules the wrong way.  I am still not sure whether this event turned out to be a bad or a good one in my life overall, but some positive consequences eventually followed.  For example, the rules where significantly clarified to avoid ambiguities in the future.

          I turned my confusion into a constructive path by refocusing on chemistry for some time.  A month or so of preparation resulted in 4<sup>th</sup> place at national olympiad.  Ukrainian conversion system to diplomas is the following: top 3 people get the first diploma (gold medal), next 6 participants get second (silver), and from 9 to 12 more contestants get third (bronze).  Mathematicians are somewhat flexible regarding these numbers, with the jury voting for the exact cutoffs based on the difference in points between participants.  For example, I earned only half of a point (out of 140) less than the third-place finisher, and the next participant was about 10 points down from me.  On a math olympiad, such a situation most probably would've resulted in me getting the first diploma.  However, chemists are somewhat stranger people, sticking precisely to the suggested cutoffs.

          This time I was determined to win, despite the political troubles with russia, which made authorities change the hosting city from Kharkiv to Kyiv.

          Physics olympiads in Ukraine are quite weird.  Seriously, you never get to know why you get the points you get.  The appeal process is obscure, with almost no people getting their marks raised.  Overall, my impressions were not great, and I decided to get back to math.

          Once you have a place at the Kyiv team secured by last year first diploma you don't pay too much attention to city olympiads, as these are rather boring.  As a consequence, you lose a point here, a point there, and it's enough to finish second.  You don't care much anyway.

          I wanted to get to the team selection test for IMO, and it was necessary to compete for 11<sup>th</sup> grade to get there, and the second diploma was just enough.  I didn't make the IMO team that year, but it was a valuable experience.

          This year was a disaster for the Ukrainian team, which almost always gets some gold medals.  However, I outperformed the rest of the team &mdash; a spoon of honey in a barrel of tar.  Nevertheless, visiting Hong Kong city was a great experience, I met great young mathematicians from all over the globe, and I still keep in touch with some of them.

<h1 id="university">
  Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv
</h1>

Thought to be one of the best Ukrainian universities by many, yet has a whole bunch of problems if you look from the inside.  I entered the department of Cybernetics, which was renamed to the Computer Science and Cybernetics department later on.  Nowadays people mainly call it CS or CSC department.  I majored in Applied Mathematics.  You can read my diploma about different algorithms for solving variational inequality [here](https://github.com/Sky-Nik/diploma/blob/master/diploma.pdf).

<h3 id="university-gpa">
  GPA
</h3>

I graduated with a GPA of 94.7/100, the best in my group by quite a margin.  However, it depends on how to calculate it.  Officials suggest counting only exams (i.e., no pass -or-fail classes, even if those give you a grade), and this is the way used here.  I also graduated with a red diploma (a.k.a. the High Honours).

  Coursework
</h3>

- First semester:

  I took Discrete Math (excellent), Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics (excellent), Python (pass), C++ I (pass), and last but not least Algorithms and Data Structures I (pass).  After the end of the semester, I continued to solve algorithmic problems and got third place in the overall rankings in the end.

  Many classes feature big projects.

  Python:

  - implement python interpreter in python;

  - implement somewhat limited analogue of map-reduce;

  - implement a telegram cinemabot (recommendations).

  C++ I:

  - a simple one about using STL structures and obeying the style guide;

  - implement a tokenizer, a parser, and an interpreter for Scheme (Lisp-alike language);

  - implement a telegram cinema bot (recommendations);

  - implement a module for NumPy in C API.

- Second semester:

  I took Algorithms and Data Structures II (excellent), finishing third-best among all the students(including hundred or so of offline learners).  I also took Machine Learning I (excellent), and C++ II (pass).

  C++ II:

  - implement jpeg decoder;

  - implement a framework for parallel execution of some code;

  - implement a clang tool (styleguide checks and dictionary support).

  Machine Learning I:

  - predict a winner in DOTA 2 &mdash; a classical one; 

  - medical diagnostics;

  - labelling stack overflow questions (about 10Gb of them).

- Third semester:

  I intend to take the following classes: Machine Learning II, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Bayesian Methods in Machine Learning, External Memory Algorithms, and Convex Analysis and Optimization.
