This is a more detailed description of my education.  It includes coursework, grades, achievements, etc.

# Physics and Mathematics Lyceum â„–208

Nothing very special about it apart from its students earning 14 medals (5G, 7S, 2B) at the IMO over the past 10 years (2010&ndash;2019).  Note that Ukraine had 11-years school education when I studied, hence Ukrainians are usually younger than other Europeans when participating in international olympiads.  For example, I graduated from school when I was 16.

### GPA

I can't remember the exact GPA, but I guess it was about 10.6/12 (in between A and A+) in my las year.  This is mainly because I was mostly preparing for IMO.  Some other years my GPA was as high as 11.5.  Anyway, I graduated with a golden medal (a.k.a. high honours).

### Coursework

Coursework includes rather standard things: algebra, geometry, physics, chemistry, biology, geography, history, sports, some languages, some literature, even art and music classes once.

### Achievements

Speaking of achievements, I took part in far too many olympiads to remember all of them.  I guess I will only mention city level and above:

- 2010 (5th grade):
    - third place at city math olympiad for 7th grade;

- 2011 (6th grade):
    - second place at city math olympiad for 7th grade;

    - second place at city math olympiad for 8th grade;

       Yeah, I wrote the olympiad for two different classes.  Such practice is somewhat unusual, but not prohibited.  In my case it was even strategially advantageous: to get into the selection round of Kyiv team for the national olympiad one had to get either first place at 7th grade or at least second place at 8th grade.  Turns out that the latter is sometimes easier.  By using this loophole I became one of something like five all-time youngest students who enetered the selection round.   

- 2012:
    -first place at city math olympiad;

- 2013:
    - first place at city chemistry olympiad;

    This one was rather unexpected.  I thought I only got talent for math, but it turned out that some preparation makes mathematicians extremely competitive in different subjects.

    - second place at city math olympiad;

    Acidentally, I didn't make the Kyiv math team for the national olympiad.  That selection test was quite controversial, with many people believing that the head of the jury interpreted rules the wrong way.  I am still not sure whether this event turned out to be a bad or a good one in my life overall, but some positive consequences eventually folowwed.  For example, the rules where significantly clarified to avoid ambiguities i nthe future.

    - second diploma at national chemistry olympiad;

    I tuned my confusion into constructive way by focusing on chemistry for some time.  A month or so of preparation resulted in me finishing in 4th absolute place at national olympiad.  Ukrainian conversion system for absolute places is the following: top 3 absolute places are considered to be the first diploma (gold medal), next 6 are second (silver), and next 9 are third (bronze).  The rest, which is usually more than a half get a participant certificate only.  Mathematicians are somewhat flexible in these numbers, voting for the exact cutoffs based on the ifference in points between participants.  For example, I earned only half a point (ouf of 140) less than the third absolute place, and the next participant was about 10 points down from me.  On a math olympiad such a situation most probably would've resulted in me getting the first diploma.  However, chemists are somewhat stranger people, sticking precisely to the suggested cutoffs.

- 2014 (9th grade):
    - second place at city chemistry olympiad;

    I took part in it rather by inertion, I had no intention of distracting from math too much.

    - first place at city math olympiad;

    The first time I was able to get to the national olympiad.

    - first diploma at national math olympiad;

    This time I was determined to win, despite the political troubles with russia, which made authorities change the hosting city from Kharkiv to Kyiv.  I finally won the first diploma, and outperformed the rest of the Kyiv team, proving that not taking me into the team last year was a mistake.  

- 2015 (10th grade):
    - second place at city geography olympiad;

    Probably the funniest olympiad I ever took part in.  One day of preparation and a lot of general knowledge was enough to get the second place.  Geography teacher was very happy.

    - second place at city physics olympiad;

    Physics olympiad in Ukraine are quite weird.  Seriously, you never get to know why you get the points you get.  The apeal process is rather obscure, with almost no people getting their point raised.  Overall, my impressions was not great, and I decided to get back to math.

    - second place at city math olympiad;

    Once you have a place at the Kyiv team secured by last year first diploma you don't pay too much attention to city olympiads, as these are rather boring.  As a consequence, you lose a point here, a point there, and it's enough to finish second.  You don't care much anyway.

    - second diploma at national math olympiad 11th grade;

    I wanted to get to the team selection test for IMO, and it was necessary to compete for 11th grade in order to get there, and the second diploma was just enough.  I didn't make the IMo team that year, but it was a very valuable experience.

- 2016 (11th grade):

    - second place at city math olympiad;

    - second diploma at national math olympiad;

    - silver medal at the International Mathematical Olympiad.

    This year was a disaster for the Ukrainian team, which almost always gets some gold medals.  However, I outperformed the rest of the team &mdash; a spoon of honey in a barrel of tar.  Nevertheless, visiting Hong Kong city was a cool experience, I met great young mathematicians from all over the globe, and I still keep in touch with some of them.
