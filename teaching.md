            I was invited to prepare their team to the National olympiad, which was rescheduled to the beginning of July (and the rescheduled once again because of the Covid19).  This time we had to work online, which turned out to be just as good as offline.  In particular, we made a fantastic decision to record all the lectures.  Now you can access them <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5XMnwBFMSgfhYAR069_s8iKkQYO59BzX">on YouTube</a>.

            Our lessons were temporarily paused by Covid19, but resumed again in April, and I returned to the program in May.  I've recorded several videos, and will release them on YouTube soon, for you to get a taste of IMO team preparation.

            This year I participated in the school rather as a programme consultant, because of an extensive experience I had.  My job was to coordinate other lecturers to ensure that they have a good understanding of who, when, and in which grade has a lecture about what.  It may not sound very difficult, but it is kinda tricky if you have 15 lecture days, 30 lecturers, and about 300 students.

            I'm afraid that my lectures for this period are not very well-documented.  I guess this is because I mostly reused the past materials for new students.  Reusability is, however, an indicator of good lectures (as well as an indicator of a good code).
