The approximate level of participants was the National Olympiad diploma and city olympiad prize places.  I was an invited lecturer in grades from 10<sup>th</sup> to 11<sup>th</sup> and conducted several lectures.

                The organizers invited me to prepare their team to the National olympiad, which rescheduled to the beginning of July.  This time we had to work online, which turned out to be just as good as offline.  In particular, we made a fantastic decision to record all the lectures.

                It is a year-round preparation program for the IMO team and reserve.  I was one of the chief lecturers for the program, conducting 14 lectures during the year, more than any other mentor.  My materials are available <a href="https://sky-nik.github.io/teaching/sources/polonskyi/">here</a>.  Beware!  These are quite advanced topics, may be challenging to understand for the beginners and younger students.

            <p>
                Our lessons temporarily paused because of Covid19 but resumed again in April, and I returned to the program in May.  I've recorded several videos and will release them on YouTube soon, for you to get a taste of IMO team preparation.

                This year I participated in the school as a programme consultant, because of the extensive experience I had.  I coordinated other lecturers to ensure that they have a good understanding of who, when, and in which grade has a lecture about what.  It may not sound challenging, but it is a bit tricky if you have 15 lecture days, 30 lecturers, and about 300 students.

                It is the best summer math school in Bukovyna, a wonderful countryside near Karpaty mountains.  For the first time, I used a website to publish my lectures.  It turned out to be a very convenient practise for both my students and me, as printing everything is not very ecology-friendly and somewhat messy.

                Year-round preparation program for mathematical olympiads for students of 5<sup>th</sup> &ndash; 11<sup>th</sup> grades.  I taught in classes from 7<sup>th</sup> to 11<sup>th</sup>.  A distinctive feature of this program is its aim on both olympiad and test preparation.  Furthermore, the organizers invite some of the senior lecturers from universities to explain the trickiest topics.

                I'm afraid that my lectures for this period are not very well-documented.  I guess this is because I mostly reused the past materials for new students.  Reusability is, however, an indicator of good lectures (as well as an indicator of excellent code).
